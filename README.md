# Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to run an analysis on the different entertainment categories throughout the U.S.A and Great Britain. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The focus for this anaylsis was theater productions because it was the biggest category. Including every year available the theater had 1,393 productions. The chart below shows the theater outcomes by month and as expected the spike is in the spring and summer. Each month aside from October and December contains almost double the amount of successful outcomes as it does failed. Overall, the theater was has been a continuously successful entertainment feature, but should only have performances from January to November. December should be left for special occasions such as Christmas performances.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

After looking at all the entertainment categories put together the successful to failed outcomes does not look as good as the theater. The chart below shows all the successful and failed outcomes based on the goal revenue. This graph shows that in the future the goals should have limits. The lower goal catergories are very successful where as the 45,000 plus goals failed miserably. My suggestion would be to focus the efforts on the middle goal categories and drop the high categories. That way the successful will stay successful and the failed can decrease increasing overall success and pledged amounts.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The Challenges that I ran into was the filtering because my version of excel only allows sorting which is permanent. I figured out that I need to either create another sheet to sort the data or use it temporarly so I can undo it easy.

Any other minor difficulties I came across were solved by trial and error over a short period of time. The syntax of different formulas, pivot tables and everything else just took a little time to understand completely. I feel confident in my ability to anaylize data through excel.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. April to August is the best time of year to launch new theater campaigns.
    2. The theater is consitantly successful compared to other categories. This means it can be used as the safety for a more risky category.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Outcomes between $15,000 and $35,000, along with outcomes greater than $45,000 will most likely fail. Every other outcome such as less than $15,000 and $35,000 to $40,000 will most likely succeed. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data is not the most up to date as we only see before year 2017. The data only focuses on developed countries with money, but leaves out some of the major countries such as France, italy, and Spain.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    1. We could look at the Outcomes based on country to see which countries produce the most successful campaigns.
    2. We could look at Outcomes based on number of Backers to see if there is a correlation between people backing the campaign and it becoming successful.
